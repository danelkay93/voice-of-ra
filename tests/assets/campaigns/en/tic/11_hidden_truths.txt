As soon as your mind returned to the present, you began formulating your plan. A plan to enter the realm of the Deep Ones and end their conspiracy once and for all. "This is ridiculous, you know that, right?" Harper asks. You nod. Of course it's ridiculous. You've spent the last two days on the run. Chased. Hunted. Tormented.
But you've also spent the last two days recovering the memories you've forgotten. And what you've seen is something you can't possibly ignore. You have seen the deity the Esoteric Order of Dagon is named for, and you understand what the Order plans to do. The alignment of the celestial bodies in the sky, the steadily rising tides, the tumultuous fluctuating weather, the creatures emerging from the deep, all of it is tied together. You have seen it. There will come a flood, a great disaster to wipe out humanity, so only the deep remains. The great city in the reef shall rise once more and become the beating heart of all life on Earth.
There are still gaps in your memory, but all this you know to be true. All of Innsmouth is consumed by this conspiracy. The Order controlled the town through its oaths and the secret wealth it hoarded from the deep. It was no wonder they treated outsiders like yourself with such scorn.
You give Harper a knowing glare. She sighs and nods. "I know. It's the only way." Together, the two of you plot your course. Abandoned ships still litter the harbor of Innsmouth. Under the cover of night, you must commandeer one of them, sail to Devil Reef, and descend once more into the antediluvian ruins in the depths below the forsaken islands. That is where the other entrance to the city lies. Y'ha-nthlei.
Your skin prickles with cold shivers as you utter the word aloud. Harper grimaces, though you can sense the determination behind her steely gaze. "I'm going to see this mission through, Dawson. For you."
You lay out all of the information you've uncovered and the relics you've obtained despite the horrors arrayed against you. You know the way to Y'ha-nthlei is sealed tight. There must be a way to gain entrance. Perhaps you already have the answers you seek…

You study the trophy you found in the sacrificial pit in which you awoke several days ago—part of what was once the creature that you fought in Devil Reef. It wasn't the same kind of creature as the "Deep Ones" that the Esoteric Order of Dagon worships, but you cannot help ruminating over the similarities between them. You recall that fish never cease growing as they age, and wonder if the same may be true for Deep Ones. Perhaps it was an ancient breed of Deep Ones—something so old, it grew enormous and twisted beyond imagination. If so what was it doing in Devil Reef? Was it guarding Y'ha-nthlei? And if so, what does that bode for you? You decide to take the trophy with you, hoping it is important enough to aid in your mission…

You understand now the purpose of the relic you found in Devil Reef. It isn't just an object of power. It is a badge—an heirloom of sorts, worn by the one who stands guard over the gateway to the Deep Ones' city. You defeated the one groomed to be its next protector. Now the relic recognizes you as its rightful heir. Perhaps with this, you will be able to gain entrance to Y'ha-nthlei…

Return Thomas Dawson to the collection. If an investigator earned Elina Harper (at any point during this campaign), they may add her back to their deck.
